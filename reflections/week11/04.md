## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I think I will be plenty prepared for my final project as long as I focus up and get all of the rough details sorted. I don't feel nervous or anxious about it at all, and think that I am thoroughly prepared.
