# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

Review for the final went well and I think I have a good grasp of everything.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

C# is a lot easier than I had anticipated after getting the hang of it.
- What are you struggling with?

Not really struggling with much, I think I am very confident in my abiliy.
- What would you count as a victory?

Won't count anything as a victory yet until I submit my final.
