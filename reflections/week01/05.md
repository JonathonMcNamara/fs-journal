# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I was able to overcome my initial rust with coding and be able to pick up on a lot of the new material relatively quickly. I was very receptive to the information and found myself paying attention to it a lot and starting to become obsessed with coding again.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
I think just the overall pace in which the class is going to move was a surprise to me. I didn't think the class would be this quick and even though it is the first week I am well aware that I need to be on top of my game at all times.
- What are you struggling with?
I tend to space out a lot and when I get home sometimes I don't do as much practice outside of class as I would like to but I need to for sure get my sleep schedule in check and really not get distracted.
- What would you count as a victory?
Attending every day and completing all the assignments to me is a victory. Getting my checkpoint done way ahead of time and being able to just tweak it all leisurely and not be stressed over it was a big change and plus since coming from school.
