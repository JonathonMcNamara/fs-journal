## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

Git is a code storage system that functions to save versions of the code and allows it to be accessed by multiple developers. This also allows for modification to be made to the code and that if there are variations or changes made that don't allow the code to function as is, you can revert the code back to a previous version. This works similarly as to restoring Windows to a previous version if you have had computer issues.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple branches serves as having multiple folders that you can work on the same base code and then alter it separately in each folder. It is a way of organizing and differentiating different variations of code that you are working on or altering.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git allows you to save and work on code from the source and always update it via your computer whereas GitHub allows you to then broadcast this code so that others can see the alterations made.
