## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

It is a selector that when you perform certain action *example :hover* the element it targets will change or shift into a certain way. I think I will use that most for my website when designing a resume.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is the priority in which multiple indicators are targeting the same element. I will use it to prioritize and override certain instances when it meets a criteria.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

You could accidentally override code that you actually want and thus it could cause issues with your website and code and over prioritize certain default styles.
