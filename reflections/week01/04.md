## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

It's basically a way to lay out your website ahead of time and develop the blueprints and format of it before you even put it to use and actually develop it.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Think of the levels of wire frames as picture quality. you have 480p for a general outline, 720p for a slightly higher definition and quality and then 1080p for the maximum amount of detail. Each one serves a purpose for how much development will need to go into the project.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I would say they are for me because I like being able to see things beforehand and am a very visual learner, so it allows people to somewhat express their ideas and thoughts about the concept and actually put them on "paper" and manifest them instead of just talking or thinking, which will lead to better development.
