## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Planning out and visualizing how you are going to write your code is very important to get a layout of what you want to create as well as easier to organize it instead of just throwing in boxes and hoping it works well together.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

I use console logs, look at the debugger and see what command I just put in and what issue I ran into, utilize google and mdi web docs and really just look up information and wording that I have issues with. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

I think the biggest thing I am really looking to utilize is just to shorten my code as much as possible to get my result. In doing this, I must really understand what I am trying to write and focus on understanding and comprehension first so that I can really grasp coding.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The boss fight was really fun to build but the biggest thing I got from this assigment was how prepared Andrew was on it and how he already had a plan and layout for the assignment and I plan to incorporate that into my future coding.
