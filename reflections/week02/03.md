## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

Kind of confused by this question but using console logs, debugger, as well as the elements on the page when opening your website are the 3 best ways to get a scope of ur website. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

You can edit the code and use console logs in the console along with editing elements to edit your page and see how each of the things you wrote in code are functioning and it gives you a lot of good error codes to debug issues with ur functions and commands

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

using console log after all of your commands and functions you input is the best way to see how your functions work, what information are the commands outputting, as well as seeing the return.
