# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?


I feel like this new mvc pattern has allowed me a way to organize my thoughts and the way in which I should code more clearly, as it really was something I lacked in the previous 2 weeks.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

I did not realize how many files could be in a single project and how many lines of code could be wrote or duplicated.
- What are you struggling with?


I think just focusing more on my assignments and getting to the point of not referencing the material is something I will always strive for.
- What would you count as a victory?


I was able to complete everything and I think I have a very good understanding of a huge new concept we are about to be on so that makes me excited.
