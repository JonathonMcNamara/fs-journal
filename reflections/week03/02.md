## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

hide information and only allow the user to access certain parts of the website that you want them to.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

using underscores allow the private closures to be accessed and much easier and fluid

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

using the underscore outside of the controller will therefore not make it usable unless you want to, and make it so that the function can be used elsewhere as well.
