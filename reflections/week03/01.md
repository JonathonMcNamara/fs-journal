## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

you can make a single script or instance more accessible across an entire project by allowing it access through main.js with the controller

2. How does export differ from export default?

the default tag doesn't differentiate the exports and therefore makes its accessibility harder.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

the module system is much more organized and once you learn it, you will know exactly where to place everything and organize it accordingly.
