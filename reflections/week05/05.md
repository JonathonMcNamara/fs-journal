# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I like being able to work with a team this week as well as finally building a full stack application to see how much needs to go into apps
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

The amount of work needed to make a full stack application and actually applying it, as well as how crisp the communication between the server and client must be
- What are you struggling with?

I think this week was really beneficial in terms of really pulling everything together and getting a good understanding of how all parts of the website translate
- What would you count as a victory?

Staying the entire time during the hackathon and really focusing on the app made it a lot of fun
