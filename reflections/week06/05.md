# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

felt like I got a really good understanding of everything and after this next week will be in great shape
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

vue can become complicated but the overall simplicity of it is so nice and the organization method is also very nice
- What are you struggling with?

sometimes I get lost as to where to start and find myself jumping around in places I don't need to instead of focusing on starting and finishing a single task
- What would you count as a victory?

getting through the week with a great mindset and being focused all week in class
