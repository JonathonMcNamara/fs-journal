## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

nested routes are specific routes to which you can travel through a site

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

you could use nested routes for when you pop errors and want to get routed to a diff page instead of being stuck on a broken one

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

just like I said above, when running into errors or invalid commands
