# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I was able to get my checkpoint on time and hit every single point on there in our final checkpoint before the final.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

I was shocked to see how my product turned out when I actually did focus on styling and trying to make it look nice.
- What are you struggling with?

Sometimes I find myself having to reference a bit too much and that at times can be discouraging so working on the capstone in the next 2 weeks I will really look to master all of the code by memory even though I am very thorough when I do reference.
- What would you count as a victory?

I didnt have any stepbacks this week and really felt like I was able to improve drastically.
