![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I really made sure that I was adapting my time to my checkpoint, timeboxed errors, as well as really just being thorough and disciplined to improve my styling on my site.

2. What went well this week?

I did not spend too much time on errors I was running into this week on my project. I was very thorough with details and how the site worked and looked to optimize the user experience itself.

3. What would you do differently?

At times I would find myself on tangents with styling and it would sometimes derail me from my main focus at that time.
