# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I really got a solid understanding of how the mvc pattern works fully and found myself really competent with tasks and how to manuever through it all.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

I did not think that we would jump straight into interacting with other websites this fast and now can see how much I have to keep up with how fast this course is.
- What are you struggling with?

I need to not procrastinate and focus on working and completing all my weekly assignments.
- What would you count as a victory?

My checkpoint is completed and I feel that my competency in coding as well as general understanding is starting to pick up.
