# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

We got a lot done on our capstone and it looks like a legit website and works smoothly for the most part.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

surprise was how well polished our website got as well as the overall functionality its amazing.
- What are you struggling with?

I had a bit of imposter syndrome for a bit but then as I worked on more things I got more confident in how I could style and get code to function.
- What would you count as a victory?

Even though I had to take a break this weekend I think making it through the 2 week process of this capstone was a huge success.
