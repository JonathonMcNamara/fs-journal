# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I think I was able to get a general flow for how C# is gonna work.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

That everything in SQL is just a massive data dump separated into tables that can then be broken down or even combined.
- What are you struggling with?

I don't know all of the things on how to structure it all without reference.
- What would you count as a victory?

Being able to connect my front end to the back end was a big plus.
