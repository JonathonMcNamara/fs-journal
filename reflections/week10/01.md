## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value, reference, pointer. All provide certain aspects in which they reference either with a value, reference the page, or point to whre it is.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

The value type data types are different from javascript in the way they are written as well as how they refer to the value. 

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?


References are used in the startup to reference and give access and are the same as javascript in how they reference. Sometimes though they use different specific files that come from out of the file that are loaded in.
