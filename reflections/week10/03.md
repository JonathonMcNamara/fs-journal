## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Columns cannot be edited where as rows can be. The column defines the row contents. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE NEW TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    name VARCHAR(255)
    AGE INT,
    DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(255)
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

first one removes from the table, 2nd removes the table.
